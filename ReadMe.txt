Title: Bank Software with ATM
Description: This program that I made was to demonstrate application development in Java. It is a replica (a small one at that) of the software used in banks, create an account, deposit, withdraw, delete account etc. 
Along with the bank class, a class ATM has also been included to replicate the ATM interface - the interface the customer will use to do his transactions.
